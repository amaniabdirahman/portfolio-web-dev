## Portfolio


This is the code repository for my personal portfolio website. It was built based on a design I found on a coding challenge website called FrontendMentor.io.The website is still a work in progress and will be undergoing periodic overhauls. Currently it relies on CSS, HTML and Javascript sprinkled with a little bit of jquery. 

## File Structure

- assets: Image files and icons exported from the figma design
- scss: sass files used to compile the final css. 
- pages: contains the html files for the contact page and the portfolio page
- index.html: main entry point for website

## Contributions

For the most part I will be working on this solo, but if you have any recommendations for improvement, don't hesitate to submit a pull request.
